        <h2>Random trivia game!</h2>
       
        <p> this is a simple trivia game, sort of similiar to Kahoot minus the fun soundtrack. When you start, you are taken to the selection screen where you can pick your catagory. Each one only has 4 questions, which you can cycle through with the next button. The reset button takes you back to the introduction screen, and you will know if you got the answer right or wrong.<br>
        The ideal way to play this is to get a group, and do it as a group. That way you guys can talk and argue about which answer is the right one. THe questions are pretty easy, but you can always add your own to customize it!</p>
